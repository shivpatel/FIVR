FIVR FTA Demo Instructions

1. Move ClientDemo and ServerDemo folder to seperate desired locations.
2. Open 2 terminal windows and change directories into each Demo folder.
3. For Client run the following command: java FIVRClient/Client
4. For Server run the following command: java FIVRServer/Server
5. Follow on-screen instructions.

NOTE: When using the "post [filename]" or "get [filename]" command in the Client window, remember that all file paths are relative to the ClientDemo folder. For example, running "post cat.jpg" would attempt to upload a file called cat.jpg found in the root level of the ClientDemo folder.
