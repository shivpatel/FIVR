FIVR FTA Demo Instructions

1. cd into src directory on 2 command lines
2. run make on one of the command lines
3. For Client use the command: java FIVRClient/Client
4. For Server use the command: java FIVRServer/Server
5. Follow on-screen instructions

Note all paths are relative. For example, to use the client's "post [filename]" command, you should use something like "post ClientFiles/image.png" to send a file called image.png from the ClientFiles folder. Note that end file will show up in ServerFiles. You should also use a similar structure with the "get [filename]" command.
